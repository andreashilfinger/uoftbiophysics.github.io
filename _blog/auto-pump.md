The idea of this experimental (and comical) project was to develop generative models based on Long-Short Term Memory Recurrent Neural Network architecture. We tried the approach on two cases:

generation of rap lyrics trained on the full discography of a famous rapper Lil Pump (Gucci Gang, skrrrr)
generation of poems trained on the poetrydb.org database

The code and the best practices are available on our [github](https://github.com/hlml-toronto/LSTM_Models).
