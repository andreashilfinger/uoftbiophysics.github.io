I"ñ<p>The idea of this experimental (and comical) project was to develop generative models based on Long-Short Term Memory Recurrent Neural Network architecture. We tried the approach on two cases:</p>

<p>generation of rap lyrics trained on the full discography of a famous rapper Lil Pump (Gucci Gang, skrrrr)
generation of poems trained on the poetrydb.org database</p>

<p>The code and the best practices are available on our <a href="https://github.com/hlml-toronto/LSTM_Models">github</a>.</p>
